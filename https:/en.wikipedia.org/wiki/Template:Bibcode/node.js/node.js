              The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA
             where YYYY is the four-digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published.
        In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number, M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published 
     (e.g., L for a letters section), PPPP gives the starting page number, and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods
            (.) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; 
      padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number.
    [1][2] Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the M column. The 6-digit article ID numbers 
                (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: 
        The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, 
            are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column M. 
      The remaining four digits are used in the page field.[2]
      
      
      A cellular automaton is a collection of "colored" 
                      cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through
              a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells.
           The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired.
